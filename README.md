 Project Name: Credit Card Fraud Detection Using Gaussian Mixture Model

Roles and Responsibilities: Developed a credit card fraud detection algorithm using Gaussian Mixture Models and PCA. Focused on data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model optimization.
Key Achievements: Tackled data distribution and class imbalance, experimenting with various model configurations. Finally build an outlier detection model that performs well in terms of F1 score.
Technologies and Tools: Utilized Python(pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn) for data analysis and algorithm development.
